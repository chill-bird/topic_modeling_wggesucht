LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

We summarized five normative arguments that address critical issues in theory building and testing, research design, and reliability and validity assessments. Using these normative arguments as criteria, we systematically reviewed 105 communication studies that applied topic modeling.

HCI researchers use a range of methods for interpreting the 'full range of human experience' from qualitative data, however, such approaches are not always scalable. Feminist geography seeks to explore how diverse and varied accounts of place can be understood and represented, whilst avoiding reductive classification systems. In this paper, we assess the extent to which unsupervised topic models can support such a research agenda. Drawing on literature from Feminist and Critical GIS, we present a case study analysis of a Volunteered Geographic Information dataset of reviews about breastfeeding in public spaces. We demonstrate that topic modelling can offer novel insights and nuanced interpretations of complex concepts such as privacy and be integrated into a critically reflexive feminist data analysis approach that captures and represents diverse experiences of place.},

Results show that, independent of the method used, ethnic discrimination against Turks does not, overall, play a substantial role among university students looking for a place to stay. However, data from the factorial survey and from the field experiment reveal that ethnic discrimination does occur in specific scenarios: while male applicants, in particular, prefer places inhabited by females, this is only the case if the females are German. In sum, our analyses demonstrate that the gender dimension needs to be taken into account when investigating discrimination intentions and ethnic discrimination in the field of close private interactions.},

We extend the challenges of online freelancing already outlined in the literature and identify four IT-specific challenges for IT freelancers. Therefore, we improve our understanding of how IT work is performed on digital labor platforms and which particular aspects should be considered in future research.

Understanding the true voice of consumers by analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content is of great significance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and e-commerce websites. The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from web-based drug reviews using the structural topic model (STM) to examine consumers' concerns when they buy drugs online. The STM is a probabilistic extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which allows the consolidation of document-level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture consumer dissatisfaction along with their dynamics over time. We extract 12 topics, and five of them are negative topics representing consumer dissatisfaction, whose appearances in the negative reviews are substantially higher than those in the positive reviews. We also come to the conclusion that the prevalence of these five negative topics has not decreased over time. Furthermore, our results reveal that the prevalence of price-related topics has decreased significantly in positive reviews, which indicates that low-price strategies are becoming less attractive to customers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using STM to analyze the unstructured textual data of drug reviews, which enhances the understanding of the aspects of drug consumer concerns and contributes to the research of pharmaceutical e-commerce literature.},

Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture. Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the close-reading of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

Adopting online platforms interconnected with the virtual world, especially the metaverse, has fostered interactive activities in diverse sectors. However, a deep understanding of how such platforms have been used and discussed in academia needs to be enriched. To tackle this issue, this study investigates the research trends of the metaverse. The search period was set to include all publication dates up to the analysis point on January 9th, 2022, so the research data of the papers published in the database until then was obtained. A total of 451 publications were collected and analyzed through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm of the topic modeling technique, exploring conspicuous topics, keywords, and pertinent publications over time. As a result, six topics were determined: Topic 1 (engaging in real and virtual worlds); Topic 2 (crypto marketplace); Topic 3 (teaching and learning in a virtual educational environment); Topic 4 (a figure of oneself traveling in a virtual world); Topic 5 (virtual marketplace reshaping retail); and Topic 6 (game-mediated activity in a virtual world community). The time series change in the number of publications on each topic was tracked, and an apparent increase was found since 2007. Further, keywords in each topic and relevant publications were obtained based on probability values and then elaborated. The findings illustrate what researchers have discussed regarding metaverse and suggest the direction for future study in the field.},

A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects.

The research results show that: firstly, the reasons for the current negative reviews of dating apps are mainly concentrated in the charging mechanism, fake accounts, subscription and advertising push mechanism and matching mechanism in the apps, proposed corresponding improvement suggestions are proposed by us; secondly, using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the text vector, and then using XGBoost model to learn the low-dimensional data after oversampling, a better classification accuracy of user reviews can be obtained. We hope These findings can help dating apps operators to improve services and achieve sustainable business operations of their apps.},

This clearly motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50\,million posts, collected from the forum using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and topic modeling -- a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview or `content map' of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor.},

  abstract = {A natural evaluation metric for statistical topic models is the probability of held-out documents given a trained model. While exact computation of this probability is intractable, several estimators for this probability have been used in the topic modeling literature, including the harmonic mean method and empirical likelihood method. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that commonly-used methods are unlikely to accurately estimate the probability of held-out documents, and propose two alternative methods that are both accurate and efficient.},

  abstract = {Young adults often face barriers in finding affordable housing due to their economic constraints and the fact that they are experiencing a distinct phase of the family life cycle. In response to this situation, there is a growing interest in shared housing as one of the solutions for housing difficulties of young single households in Korea. In spite of numerous studies highlighting the characteristics and benefits of shared housing, we still have a limited understanding regarding which young single households have particular interests in shared housing. This study fills this gap by examining various determinants of preference for shared housing among young single households in Seoul, South Korea. Based on a household drop-off survey of 1000 respondents, this study utilized a binary logistic regression model to identify various determinants---socio-demographic, personal, dwelling, and locational characteristics of young singles---that may affect the preference for shared housing. Furthermore, our analyses accounted for rental housing submarkets to specify how these determinants of preference for shared housing vary across a city as well as neighborhoods stratified by housing rent. Our findings may help planning practitioners and policymakers to provide better shared housing options across neighborhoods and develop housing policies to encourage young people to choose shared housing arrangements.},
